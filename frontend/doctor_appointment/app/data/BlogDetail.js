        description: "Tooth extraction is a common dental procedure performed to remove a tooth from its socket in the bone. This may be necessary due to severe decay, infection, crowding, or trauma. The process typically involves numbing the area with local anesthesia to ensure patient comfort. After the extraction, proper care is essential to promote healing and prevent complications such as infection or dry socket. Patients are usually advised to avoid strenuous activity, not to disturb the extraction site, and to follow specific oral hygiene instructions provided by their dentist. Tooth extraction can help alleviate pain, prevent the spread of infection, and prepare the mouth for further dental treatments if needed.",

        description: "Dental implants are advanced restorative solutions designed to replace missing teeth and restore both function and aesthetics. The procedure involves surgically placing a titanium post into the jawbone, which acts as an artificial tooth root. Over time, the implant integrates with the bone, providing a stable foundation for a crown, bridge, or denture. Dental implants offer several benefits, including improved chewing ability, enhanced appearance, and preservation of jawbone structure. They are a durable and long-lasting option, often preferred over traditional dentures or bridges. Proper oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups are essential to ensure the longevity and success of dental implants.",
